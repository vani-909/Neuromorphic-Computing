# Neuromorphic-Computing - Hardware for Efficient AI  (TODO)

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the CartPole-v1 environment using hardware-aware training based on real-world device measurements. The code simulates synapse behaviour with non-idealities such as non-linearity, asymmetry, and stochastic gain.

## Project Structure


The data analysis is performed in Data_AnalysisV2.ipynb, and uses the data for TEST2, Data_Analysis.ipynb is the experimental file. 


## How to run

1. Install dependencies:

2. Run training:

**python Model.py**

3. Analyze results:
- Plots are saved in Images/
- Episode rewards and duration are logged in logs/

## Utitilies
